This is a chat application created using Spring Boot. This project includes concepts like Socket programming and Multithreading. The highlight is it will store the user logs and most importantly the backup of all the chats which will be stored in MySQL using the concept of JDBC. Also to give a UI experience swing is also used in this project.
The complete code was written no drag and drop as it was made in IntelliJ.

1)Code for server end in "Server.java"

2)Three classes for clients

3)To store data in mysql there is "DBOperations.java"

For now maximum of 3 users can chat simultaneously. The response time of the app is also very good.
